## üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇ How to navigate the project?

### All source code files are located in: `./src`

## üõà Project Structure

- `./src/api:` Contains the GraphQL API provided by the Rocketseat team. It includes the e-commerce product data.

- `./src/app:` This is a Next.js project using the App Router, so each folder is a route. Inside the app folder, you'll find:
  - `layout.tsx`: Imports global styles and fonts, sets metadata (title, description), and wraps the app with contexts.
  - `page.tsx`: The homepage (our first route).
  - Pages folder with two main routes:
    - `cartPage`: The shopping cart page.
    - `produtos`: Responsible for displaying individual product pages.

- `./src/assets:` Contains all images and static files used in the project.

- `./src/components:` Reusable components used across the project. This version includes:
    - Buttons
    - Header
    - Site navigation: Nav
    - Page switching: TogglePagination

- `./src/contexts:` Contexts share data across the application. In this version:
  - Filter (folder: Filters)
  - Pages (folder: Pages)
  - Note: `AppProvider.tsx` gathers all context providers and exports them as a single file.

- `./src/hooks:` Custom hooks that contain the application logic.

- `./src/services:` Contains service functionalities. In this version, only one file `QueryClient.ts` creates and exports the QueryClient provider in the same file using `'use client'`, instead of placing it in the layout.

- `./src/styles:` Styling files. This version has one file: `GlobalStyles.css` which handles global styles.

## ‚ùî How to run the project on your machine?

- First, make sure you have Git installed on your machine. Git allows you to clone and manage code repositories.
    - Windows: Download Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the installation steps.
    - macOS: Install Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac" target="_blank">here</a> or via Homebrew:
        ```bash
        brew install git
        ```
    - Linux: Use your distro's package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:
        ```bash
        sudo apt install git
        ```

- Open a terminal (on Windows, you can use Git Bash which comes with Git).

- Navigate to the folder where you want to save the project.

- Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeFranciscoPereira/Capputeeno.git
    ```

- Navigate into the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd Capputeeno
    ```

- Open the project with your preferred code editor (example with VSCode):
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

- üö® Important: To avoid code errors after cloning, install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

- Once you have the project on your machine, you need to start both the website and the API. Follow the steps below:

  - Open the terminal and run the command below to start the website:
    - To start the website, run:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

  - To start the API, follow these steps:

    - 1:  
      Open a new terminal and keep the one running the website open.

    - 2:
      ```bash
      cd src/api
      ```

    - 3:
      ```bash
      npm i
      ```

    - 4:
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
